# Track-workplace-condition-to-ensure-employee-safety-in-ware-house

In this project we have used Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to train a model that can predict if a employee is wearing the helmet or not while working in a warehouse, model is trained using *Tensorflow Backend Libraries* and we have acheived over 93% accuracy, The project is in ready to deploy in various warehouses and industrial workplaces


Libraries used:
-
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
